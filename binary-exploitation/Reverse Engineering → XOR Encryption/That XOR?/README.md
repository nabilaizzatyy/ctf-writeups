# That XOR?

## Challenge Overview
A .exe file given contains a binary code that required a password. Need to crack it to find the flag.

---   
## Tools Used
- WinRAR
- Ghidra on dogbolt.org
---
   
## Methodology / Steps
### 1. Inspected binary strings and noticed it used XOR, and flag format is ictff{%s}

### 2. Decompiled binary using Ghidra on dogbolt.org

From this code, we learn that:
- The password must be exactly 7 characters long
- The input is XORed with the key 0x37
- The encrypted flag need to decrypt by key 0x42
- The result is compared with a hard coded 7 byte value stored in the binary

### 3. Identified XOR key 0x37 for password.
From the code:
-	local_3c = 0x5a43525b;
-	uStack_38 = 0x595e52;
the architecture is little endian, these values are stored in memory as:
5b 52 43 5a 52 5e 59 (These bytes represent the XOR encrypted password)

### 4. Recover the Password.
Encrypted ^ Key = Original

we already found the XORed key is 0X37
- 0x5b ^ 0x37 = l
- 0x52 ^ 0x37 = e
- 0x43 ^ 0x37 = t
- 0x5a ^ 0x37 = m
- 0x52 ^ 0x37 = e
- 0x5e ^ 0x37 = i
- 0x59 ^ 0x37 = n
#### Password = letmein

### 5. Find the possible encrypted flag.
local_48 and local_40 is the encrypted data, also in little-endian.
- 2d 3a 27 2e 32 2f 2b 31 30
### 6. Decrypt the encrypted flag
To decrypt the flag, key used is 0x42.
- 0x2d ^ 0x42 = s
- 0x3a ^ 0x42 = i
- 0x27 ^ 0x42 = m
- 0x2e ^ 0x42 = p
- 0x32 ^ 0x42 = l
- 0x2f ^ 0x42 = e
- 0x2b ^ 0x42 = x
- 0x31 ^ 0x42 = o
- 0x30 ^ 0x42 = r

### Flag string: simplexor

---
## Vulnerability Explanation
 XOR encryption with hardcoded keys made it easily reversible through analysis. 

---
## Flag / Result
### ictff8{simplexor}

## Mitigation / What I Learned
- I learn to understand the code in Ghidra (it is my first time using it)
